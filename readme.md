# What is ARMaker?
ARMaker is a simple little project I threw together one day when I needed to generate some professional looking AR targets for Vuforia but wanted to have a high number of tracking points. I have since extended it to also include a generator for ARToolkit markers following their recommended format.
# Background
I am relatively new to augmented reality but one issue I observed immediately was the lack of a good resource for generating highly trackable and uniform markers. For example, Vuforia provides a great sample image but as soon as you need to expand to multiple markers, you are left tracking down (oh the puns) your own set of markers. In addition, I wanted to be able to provide a uniform look to the markers without needed to generate each one by hand. This need is what led me to create the above utility.
